# odin-recipes
- First project for the Odin Project
- This is just going to be a simple, static webpage. I am going to build a homepage and three recipe pages of meals that I get to choose. I hope 

# What this really is
- What I am really doing is putting to practice what I have learned so far and showcasing my grasp on the subjects and lanuages. I am going to :
- build a homepage adding links to my recipes
- make use of the simple HTML tags I have learned like <h1> <ol> <ul> <li> <p> and so on.
- I am going to add pictures with <img> element, remembering to properly  use the attributes ive been taught
- Then I am going to use <git commands> to push my work to github and publish it for the public.

# Adding CSS
- Coming soon..
