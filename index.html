    <h1>Recipes of the Old Gods</h1>

<p>
  I feel like it's only fair to pay tribute to the old Norse god after whom this  
  curriculum is named: <strong>Woden. The All-Father.</strong> Sometimes called
  the <em>Hooded One</em> or the <em>Wanderer</em>. No matter the name, he opened his Great Hall 
  in Valhalla and, with the fallen warriors, feasts on the best game, 
  endless mead, all the fruits of the world, breads, and cheeses. 
  With the palate of a true king and the appetite of a bear, I think this 
  website of recipes is quite fitting for the first project in The Odin Project. 
</p>
<p>
  With a little research and some digging through my grandmother’s oldest 
  recipes, I came up with these three meals that I believe are fit for any
  god, king, warrior, or coder. Without further ado, here are my three 
  choices.
</p>

<h3><a href="recipes/boar.html">Roast Boar of Everlasting Glory (Sæhrímnir)</a></h3>

<p>
    In the sagas, the cook Andhrímnir slaughters the magical boar Sæhrímnir
    every night, and by morning it is whole again to feed Odin’s warriors.
</p>

<h3><a href="recipes/fowl.html">Mead-Glazed Fowl of the Valkyries</a></h3>

<p>
   Mead was the drink of the gods, flowing endlessly in Valhalla from the
   goat Heiðrún. To honor that, a bird roasted with mead glaze sounds fitting. 
</p>

<h3><a href="recipes/fruits.html">Hearth-Cheese & Honeyed Fruits of Idunn</a></h3>

<p>
    The goddess Idunn guarded apples of immortality — fruit that gave 
    the gods eternal youth. At Odin’s table, cheese and fruit would be served 
    as symbols of plenty.
